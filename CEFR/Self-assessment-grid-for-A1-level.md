## Understanding

### Listening

I can understand familiar words and very basic phrases concerning myself, my family and immediate concrete surroundings when people speak slowly and clearly.

### Reading

I can understand familiar names, words and very simple sentences, for example on notices and posters or in catalogues.

## Speaking

### Spoken interaction

- I can interact in a simple way provided the other person is prepared to repeat or rephrase things at a slower rate of speech and help me formulate what I'm trying to say.
- I can ask and answer simple questions in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.

### Spoken production
I can use simple phrases and sentences to describe where I live and people I know.

## Writing

- I can write a short, simple postcard, for example sending holiday greetings.
- I can fill in forms with personal details, for example entering my name, nationality and address on a hotel registration form.
